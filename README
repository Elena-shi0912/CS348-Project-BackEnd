2. How to run the working database-driven application?

Pre-requisite: You have NodeJS set up properly
Step 1: Create the directory (named as carpool here) for workspace
Step 2: Under carpool directory, clone the front-end code into client dir using command : git clone https://github.com/Elena-shi0912/CS348-Project-FrontEnd.git
                                 clone the back-end code into server dir using command : git clone https://github.com/Elena-shi0912/CS348-Project-BackEnd.git
Step 3: In clinet dir, run npm start [a web page should appear in either Firefox or Google browse and this is the user interface for this application]
Step 4: In client dir, run npm start [start the backend server]
Step 5: You are free to use the application web page now!


3. What feature it currently supports?
